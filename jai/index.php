        Love
        I've been on the road for hours all alone
        Just to get to you
        Love
        Oh I could do this everyday
        So come my way

        Say a prayer
        Say a prayer before I turn off the lights
        Get undressed
        Get undressed, there ain't no reason to hide
        'Coz not everybody's obsessed with a body
        I'm up for the beauty and light from within
        You have me already, this ain't ordinary
        My hands get unsteady everytime you let me in

        I've been attached with the feeling
        Of love reciprocating and waking up with you by my side
        Stuck in the same page for ages
        But baby you're ageless
        And fate is in our hands somehow

        I'm happy with you
        I'm happy with you 
        I'm happy with you 
        I'm happy with you 
        I'm happy with you

        What I'd do to have you under my sheets
        What I would do to feel your heat
        You turn a glow into a fire
        My love don't expire, you're my lifeline 
        You are all I crave and all I seek
        Yet I'll take it day by day, don't give a fuck 'bout the wait
        Man that's a promise, I'm bein' honest

        You, nothing compares to me and you
        You, you are the one I belong to

        Oh I've been attached with the feeling
        Of love reciprocating and waking up with you by my side
        Stuck in the same page for ages 
        But baby you're ageless 
        And fate is in our hands somehow

        I'm happy with you
        I'm happy with you 
        I'm happy with you
        I'm happy with you
        I'm happy with you

        I've been on the road for hours all alone
        Just to get to you
        Love
        Oh I could do this everyday
        So come my way

        Say a prayer
        Say a prayer before I turn off the lights
        Get undressed
        Get undressed, there ain't no reason to hide
        'Coz not everybody's obsessed with a body
        I'm up for the beauty and light from within
        You have me already, this ain't ordinary
        My hands get unsteady everytime you let me in

        I've been attached with the feeling
        Of love reciprocating and waking up with you by my side
        Stuck in the same page for ages
        But baby you're ageless
        And fate is in our hands somehow

        I'm happy with you
        I'm happy with you 
        I'm happy with you 
        I'm happy with you 
        I'm happy with you

        What I'd do to have you under my sheets
        What I would do to feel your heat
        You turn a glow into a fire
        My love don't expire, you're my lifeline 
        You are all I crave and all I seek
        Yet I'll take it day by day, don't give a fuck 'bout the wait
        Man that's a promise, I'm bein' honest

        You, nothing compares to me and you
        You, you are the one I belong to

        Oh I've been attached with the feeling
        Of love reciprocating and waking up with you by my side

        You have me already, this ain't ordinary
        My hands get unsteady everytime you let me in

        I've been attached with the feeling
        Of love reciprocating and waking up with you by my side
        Stuck in the same page for ages
        But baby you're ageless
        And fate is in our hands somehow

        I'm happy with you
        I'm happy with you 
        I'm happy with you 
        I'm happy with you

        What I'd do to have you under my sheets
        What I would do to feel your heat
        You turn a glow into a fire
        My love don't expire, you're my lifeline 
        You are all I crave and all I seek
        Yet I'll take it day by day, don't give a fuck 'bout the wait
        Man that's a promise, I'm bein' honest

        You, nothing compares to me and you
        You, you are the one I belong to

        Oh I've been attached with the feeling
