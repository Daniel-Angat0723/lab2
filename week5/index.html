                Hi guys! This is the index page for my Lab2 which includes learnings from W3Schools as well as some personal tricks that I learned myself
                online Hehe. The topics we are tackling right now are introductions in HTML and CSS which is really essential. I hope that we won't be 
                needing JavaScript as it is very hard for me. Also, I wanted to share to you my interests in cats. So here is a series of cat images.

                By the way, I am a BS Com Sci student specializing in CyberSecurity on its 2nd Year. For the most part I enjoy back-end coding as well as
                a little bit of front-end. I like to ride bikes as well as take care of my fur babies. This concludes my introductions, thank you!
